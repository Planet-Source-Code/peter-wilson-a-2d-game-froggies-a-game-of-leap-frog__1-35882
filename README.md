### Description

Simple game of leap-frog suitable for all ages.

Uses multi-dimension arrays, images and bitmaps, drag-n-drop, simple game logic, auto-creation of new swamps, registry setting! Unlike other games, this one has a well-rounded finish to it, including help file.

Code is commented, and does not assume too much VB knowledge. If you are not too good at Arrays, then you may need a quick refresher course, otherwise this is a good learning project for them.
